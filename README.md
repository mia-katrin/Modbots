# The code for the master thesis

Most of the implemented Python functionality lies in the package "modbots", and all scripts outside of this package is used to run evolution ("evolve.py") and similar results-based scripts. Many of the scripts here are also made to run the experiments, and get overviews of the experiments on different servers.  

The C# code related to the simulator made in Unity is in the folder Modbots_v2.
